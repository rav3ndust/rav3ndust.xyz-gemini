## internet

The internet needs no introduction, at least at a conceptual level. You know what it is - after all, you're on it right now!

There are so many layers to the internet, though, and a lot of ways that you can avoid using the services of the "corporate web", as I like to call it. If you want to check out more decentralized and "smallweb" things, this next area is for you to check out.
